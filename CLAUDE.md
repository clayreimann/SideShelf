# Generated documentation

- Place generated documents and reports in `docs/investigation`, `docs/reports`, `docs/architecture` or another appropriate subdirectory.
- Please don't prompt me to write a new markdown document to a file, just write the file
- Documents in `docs/architecture` should focus on strategy and rationale. Code-level advice that might be found in JSDoc should be in actual comments in the code rather than in a markdown doc.
- Please add documentation in `docs/architecture` for major features and systems changes.

# Testing
